\end{rSection}
\begin{rSection}{Summary}
I have a diverse background with graduation in Physics and research training in Nanoscience followed by masters in Computer Science. After doing a successful start up derived from my master thesis and working in Indian IT company for 6.5 years, I moved to Europe to pursue my passion for research and knowledge. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in ``Graph Data stream mining and distributed processing" from ULB(Brussels) and UPC(Barcelona). My research focuses on designing efficient one pass algorithms to analysis large interaction networks such as social media network. I have also worked on Influence maximization and Information propagation problems using Interaction network. While visiting UPC Barcelona, I worked on distributed graph processing and large graph data management, where I focused on using cost model based approach for adaptive graph partitioning on Apache GraphX. Currently, I am working on fraud detection by studying cyclic patterns on a transactional network. Apart from my research, I also work part-time as big data consultant working on different big data platforms, and conduct online courses for Big data systems like Hadoop ecosystem, Spark, Machine Learning using Python and Deep learning for an Indian company.
